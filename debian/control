Description: Arora is a lightweight cross-platform web browser
 Arora runs on Linux, embedded Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, Windows and any other
 platforms supported by the Qt toolkit.
 .
 Arora uses the QtWebKit port of the fully standards-compliant WebKit layout
 engine. It features fast rendering, powerful JavaScript engine and supports
 NPAPI plugins.
 .
 Apart from the must-have features such as bookmarks, history and tabbed
 browsing Arora boasts:
  - Very fast startup
  - Integration with desktop environments
  - Smart location bar
  - Session management
  - Privacy mode
  - Flexible search engine management via OpenSearch framework
  - ClickToFlash plugin
  - Download manager
  - WebInspector, a set of tools for web developers
  - > 30 translations
 .
 Arora began as a demo by Benjamin Meyer to help test the QtWebKit component,
 but since then it has grown into its own project outside of Qt.
